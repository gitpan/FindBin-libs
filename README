This should work anyplace perl can split directories on
'/', which inclues *NIX, OS/X, and cygwin that I know of;
it will fail on Windows/DOS and VMS. In particular, the
crazy directory structures common to Windows systems 
do not seem very amenable to using $FindBin::Bin as the
starting point for locating libraries; VMS would be better
off hard-coding a virtual device for the local lib's.


The pod describes using the module in a few situations, 
any suggestions appreciated. In particular, I toyed with
several ways of passing in switches. The one used here 
was chosen because it supports qw( ... ) syntax with 
optional parameters (e.g., qw(export) and qw(export=foo)).


Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL;
	make test install;
	perldoc FindBin::libs;
