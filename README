This should work anyplace perl can split directories on
'/', which inclues *NIX, OS/X, and cygwin that I know of.

The pod describes using the module in a few situations, 
any suggestions appreciated. In particular, I toyed with
several ways of passing in switches. The one used here 
was chosen because it supports qw( ... ) syntax with 
optional parameters (e.g., qw(export) and qw(export=foo)).

Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL;
	make test install;
	perldoc FindBin::libs;
