This should work anyplace File::Spec can split directories,
which should be anywhere Perl runs these days.

This may not do much good on Windows: the crazy 
directory structures common to Windows systems 
do not seem very amenable to using $FindBin::Bin 
as the starting point for locating libraries.

Anyone with access to VMS warn me if this works
at all -- through judicious use of virtual devices
should make it useful.

The pod describes using the module in a few situations, 
any suggestions appreciated. In particular, I toyed with
several ways of passing in switches. The one used here 
was chosen because it supports qw( ... ) syntax with 
optional parameters (e.g., qw(export) and qw(export=foo)).

Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL;
	make test install;
	perldoc FindBin::libs;
