1.06 Sat Apr 30 00:24:23 EDT 2005

- Set print to undef -- should've been that way
  to begin with.

1.05 Thu Nov  4 17:35:31 EST 2004

- Wrap abs_path in an eval to handle systems that die on
  non-existant directories.

1.03 Wed Oct 20 12:03:30 EDT 2004

- Fix doc bug -- added /jowbloe/ below /home on the 
  sandbox examples.

1.03 Tue Oct 19 17:13:04 EDT 2004

- Update doc's to include sandbox manglement.

1.02 Thu Jun 10 14:26:53 CDT 2004

- Fix typo in version number.

1.01 Mon May 31 21:13:13 CDT 2004

- Modify the split for ignored arguments to ignore whitespace
  around the comma separators. This only applies to cases where
  the caller doesn't use qw() for the arguments and ends up 
  with something like: 'ignore=/, /foo'.

- Repair default arg's to successfully ignore '/' and
  '/usr' by default.

- Eval symlink creation to handle systems without symlinks.

  Caveat utilitor: this module has only been tested by me on
  *NIX, the assumed directory separation on '/' is most
  likely broken on ms-dos, VMS, or related filesystems. If
  any currently available *NIX lacks symlinks please warn
  me, otherwise YMMV.

- Cleaned up some comments.

1.00 Mon Mar 22 11:18:45 CST 2004

- Up the version number. Thing seems stable enough to call it
  1.00 at this point.

- Reverse the order of CHANGES, with most recent at the top.

0.18 Tue Mar 16 22:22:02 CST 2004

- Added -e test before abs_path to avoid nastygrams
  from Cwd on abs_path of dangling links.

0.17 Mon Mar  8 23:25:20 CST 2004

- Removed leftover $DB::single (d'oh...)

0.16 Sat Jan 24 14:52:23 CST 2004

- Replaced 0 with undef for default print. noprint is
  now the default.

0.15 Sat Jan 24 14:46:22 CST 2004

- POD

0.14 Wed Dec  3 12:23:42 CST 2003

- Modify Makefile.PL to use ABSTRACT_FROM, NAME entry of POD to 
  add abstract.

- Added notes to README.

- Included test for bogus directory (unless you DO have a 
  ./frobnicatorium) w/ exported array empty.

0.13 Wed Dec  3 10:12:13 CST 2003

- pod for sandbox description.

0.11 Wed Nov 26 16:08:35 CST 2003

- Fixed switch bug for handling print/noprint & verbose.
- test.pl failed on Solaris due to /bin -> /usr/bin, test
  changed to regex from eq.
